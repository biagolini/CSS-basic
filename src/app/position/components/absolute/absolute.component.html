<h1>Absolute</h1>

<p>
  An element with position: absolute; is positioned relative to the nearest
  positioned ancestor (instead of positioned relative to the viewport, like
  fixed):
</p>

<div class="relative">
  This div element has position: relative;
  <div class="absolute">This div element has position: absolute;</div>
</div>
